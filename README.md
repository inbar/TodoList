#### This is my Todo list
This list exists mainly for people who try to use my Github account to conclude such things as what kind of a person I am, what kind of a programmer I am, if I love code (whatever that means), etc.
note that the 'Todo' is written as one word. that's becuse i'm a programmer and i'm cool.  

TODO  
 =====
* ~~Make a Todo list~~  
* ~~Put the Todo list on gihub~~
* Fork some cool projects using trending languages and pretend to work on them.
* Fork the trending languages's repo and pretend to work on that.
* Do some name dropping.
* Golang
* Make an opinionated statement about something computer related, and subtly insinuate that i would do it _much_ better.
* Figure out how to do a line break in Markdown. I mean for GODS SAKE, how hard could it be to write a proper mark up language?!
